                This project was created for my Artificial Intelligence class in the Summer of 2017. This project was
                called Gridworld, and had us creating an AI that was able to learn a state space after running through
                the space a few hundred times and be able to
                path-find its way to the center no matter where it was dropped on the map. The arrows on the grid show
                the confidence in the AI in how sure that
                any one particular direction points towards the goal. I also designed the GUI myself from scratch using
                the GUI tools available in Java; using things like JFrame and JPanel. </br> </br>

                A link to my Github repo is available in the Github tab at the top of the web page. The source code has
                some of the functionality for adding walls and obstacles to the gridworld map, however most of this is
                unimplemented due to time limits within the time limits of the class.
